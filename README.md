hangouts_to_irc.rb
==================

Converts a Hangouts.json file generated with Google Takeout into a human-readable format.

Usage: 
`./parse_chat.rb Hangouts.json`

This will spit out all of your chats named semi-appropriately. It looks awful, but it works well enough for our purposes.

#TODO
- mappings for get_friendly_name, preferably in a mappings.yml file
